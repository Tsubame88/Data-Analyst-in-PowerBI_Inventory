Inventory Analysis Metrics 
+ Average inventory value
  
 is often used to know the value of an item during a specific period that accounts for seasonal fluctuations

     Avg inventory value =  ( Starting value + Ending Value ) / 2
+ Inventory turnover
  
is the measurement of the number of times a businessâ€™s inventory is sold throughout a month, a quarter, or (most commonly) a year of trading. In other words, inventory turnover measures how fast a company sells. 

In most typical cases, slow turnover ratios indicate weak sales (and possible excess inventory), while faster turnover ratios indicate strong sales (and a possible inventory shortage). 
 
     Inventory turnover  =  COGS / Avg inventory value
+ ABC analysis
  
  ABC analysis is a technique that helps you prioritize inventory management by classifying your items into three categories: A, B, and C. You can do ABC analysis in four steps. First, you need information on the revenue of your items; then, you calculate the percentage they represent from the total revenue. Once you have the percentages, you must sort the column in descending order to allow the computation of a cumulative increase. Finally, you classify the items according to a rule of how much they cover of total revenue. A items will cover up to seventy percent of total revenue, B items will cover the following twenty percent, and C items will represent the remaining percentage.
