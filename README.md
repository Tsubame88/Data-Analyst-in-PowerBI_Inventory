## Inventory Analysis Metrics 
+ Average inventory value
  
 is often used to know the value of an item during a specific period that accounts for seasonal fluctuations

     Avg inventory value =  ( Starting value + Ending Value ) / 2
+ Inventory turnover
  
is the measurement of the number of times a businessâ€™s inventory is sold throughout a month, a quarter, or (most commonly) a year of trading. In other words, inventory turnover measures how fast a company sells. 

In most typical cases, slow turnover ratios indicate weak sales (and possible excess inventory), while faster turnover ratios indicate strong sales (and a possible inventory shortage). 
 
     Inventory turnover  =  COGS / Avg inventory value
+ ABC analysis
  
  ABC analysis is a technique that helps you prioritize inventory management by classifying your items into three categories: A, B, and C.
    1. information on the revenue of items 
    2. calculate the percentage they represent from the total revenue
    3. sort the column in descending order to allow the computation of a cumulative increase
    4. classify the items according to a rule of how much they cover of total revenue.
    
    A items will cover up to seventy percent of total revenue, B items will cover the following twenty percent, and C items will represent the remaining percentage.

    In this study case, Almost 70% of total revenue is located in these 18 items out of total of 104 items. So we could pay attention to these items.
